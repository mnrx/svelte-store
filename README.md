# `@mnrx/svelte-store`

This is a re-implementation of `svelte/store` which offers more accurate
tracking of derived store validity, ensuring that re-evaluations do not happen
on invalid upstream state. It also includes expanded TypeScript support and a
small addition to the public API of `get()`.

For more information, see the [pull request to Svelte][pr].
